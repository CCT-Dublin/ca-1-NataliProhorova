These ratings are often summarized by a numerical rating, or the number of stars. Of course there is more value in the actual text itself than the quantified stars. And at times, the given rating does not truly convey the experience of the product – the heart of the feedback is actually in the text itself. The goal therefore is to build a classifier that would understand the essence of a piece of review and assign it the most appropriate rating based on the meaning of the text.\n","\n","**Background**\n","Though product ratings on Amazon are aggregated from all the reviews by every customer, each individual rating is actually only an integer that ranges from one star to five stars. This reduces our predictions to discrete classes totaling five possibilities. Therefore what we'll have is a supervised, multi-class classifier with the actual review text as the core predictor.\n","\n","This study is an exploration of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal of predicting the star rating given a piece of text will take on different NLP topics including word embedding, topic modeling, and dimension reduction. From there, we'll arrive at a final dataframe and we'll be employing different machine learning techniques in order to come up with the best approach (i.e. most accurate estimator) for our classifier.\n","\n","**Datasets**\n","The Amazon dataset contains the customer reviews for all listed Electronics products spanning from May 1996 up to July 2014. There are a total of 1,689,188 reviews by a total of 192,403 customers on 63,001 unique products.

He's a famous bounty hunter in Oregon in the 1890s who, when he shot the man in the saloon, just finished a years long quest to avenge his sister's murder and is now trying to figure out what to do next. When the snotty-nosed farm boy he just rescued from a gang of bullies offers him money to kill a man who forced him off his ranch, he reluctantly agrees to bring the man to justice, but not to kill him outright. But, first he needs to tell his sister's widower the news.Kyla \"Kyle\" Springer Bailey has been riding the trails and sleeping on the ground for the past month while trying to find Jace. She wants revenge on the man who killed her husband and took her ranch, amongst other crimes, and she's not so keen on the detour Jace wants to take. But she realizes she's out of options, so she hides behind her boy persona as best she can and tries to keep pace. When a confrontation along the way gets her shot and Jace discovers that Kyle's a Kyla, she has to come clean about the *whole* reason she needs this scoundrel dead and hope he'll still help her.The book has its share of touching moments and slow-blooming romance. Kyla, we find out, has good reason to fear men and hide behind a boy's persona. Watching Jace slowly pull her out of that shell and help her conquer her fears was endearing. Her pain was real and deeply-rooted and didn't just disappear in the face of his sexiness. Neither did his understandable aversion to marriage magically disappear after a round of nookie. Why would a man who's drifted from town to town for his entire adult life - a man who's killed his fair share of men along the way - feel he'd make a good husband or father? They're both the walking wounded and in a unique position to help each other, they just need time to realize it.However, while it was packed to bursting with my favorite themes - Old West setting, a heroine passing as male, a morally ambiguous hero, wounded souls, road romance, the kitchen sink - there was a certain...distance in the writing that kept me from getting carried away. Both characters were distinct and fully-formed and I couldn't point to any glaring instances of bland telling or anything, I just never felt really invested. I enjoyed it quite a bit, as it was an exciting trip, but I was watching them from far away. I definitely wasn't on the run alongside them. Add on a hasty and too tidy ending, and the book left me feeling a bit less than completely satisfied.I enjoyed the book, but I can't say it was above average. I'd still read another book by the author.Note: I read the re-released ebook version and noticed there were a lot of formatting errors and missing words. I had to mentally edit as I read for some sentences to make sense. It wasn't too too bad, but it was a little distracting.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(data_df['rating'].unique())"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"LKlziPXiZnzP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1743025444967,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":26,"user":{"displayName":"Natali Rubymills","userId":"15864455374037802262"}},"outputId":"b8601096-7544-496d-deba-25040382fc6e"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[3 5 4 2 1]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(data_df['rating'].unique())"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"HtygwGWcac-Q","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1743025542044,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":15,"user":{"displayName":"Natali Rubymills","userId":"15864455374037802262"}},"outputId":"743ae8fe-8128-4023-dec0-d13f767fdcdc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[3 5 4 2 1]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["NLP Pre-Processing\n","We'll work with reviewText to prepare our model's final dataframe.
